## About LyricLysteners

This is a mobile first application where a user may enter the artist and song name and when they search, the lyrics are given back to them. Not only does the user recieve lyrics but they also recieve a customized QR code that takes the user to that YouTube video that corresponds to the song. Since the website was designed mobile first we made sure the QR button was accessible for users on their phone. Thus, when the QR code is tapped or clicked by the user it works as a link to take them to the same video.
